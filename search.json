Coupled with financial and accounting data, these metrics provide a comprehensive view of a company’s performance and risk.\n##Objective:\nHypothesis: Higher ESG risk ratings (indicating greater unmanaged risks in environmental, social, and governance areas) are associated with poorer financial health and lower profitability.\nObjective: To analyze the financial performance of companies with different levels of ESG risk ratings and identify any significant correlations.\n##Data Collection\nThe data for this project was collected using Python. Financial and accounting data were retrieved using the yfinance library, and ESG data was collected using Selenium to scrape Yahoo! Finance’s Sustainability section.\n##Descriptive Statistics\nFirst, let’s load the collected data and calculate the descriptive statistics.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport

be analyzed are ESG ratings and certain financial data believed to have greater correlations with the ESG ratings. Now, lets analyze a heatmap comparing the correlations between ESG scores and the selected financial Data.\n\nheatmap_data = avg_merged_data[['Total ESG Risk Score', 'Environmental Risk Score', 'Social Risk Score','Governance Risk Score','Total Revenue','Rent And Landing Fees', 'Research And Development','Preferred Stock Dividends','Insurance And Claims']]\ncorr = heatmap_data.corr()\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=\".2f\", linewidths=.5)\nplt.title('Correlation Heatmap of ESG Risk Ratings and Financial Data')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nJudging by the heatmap, its clear to see that ESG ratings do not have much of an effect on most financial data. However, there is a moderate correlation of .43 between “Preferred Stock Dividends” and the “Social Risk Score”.\n##Exploratory Data Analysis\nLets analyze this relationship further.\n\nsns.lineplot(x='Preferred Stock Dividends', y='Social Risk Score', data=heatmap_data, marker='o')\nplt.title('Average Preferred Stock Dividends vs Social Risk Score')\nplt.xlabel('Average Preferred Stock Dividends')\nplt.ylabel('Social Risk Score')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Social Risk Score')\n\n\n\n\n\nJudging by the linegraph, its clear to see that most of the data is inconclusive. This was easy to assume with the correlation coefficient of .43, however, there is some indication that as the “Social Risk Score” increases, the “Average Preferred Stock Dividends” increases. This may indicate that companies with higher social risk scores offer higher preferred stock dividends in order to retain investors despite the higher risk. Alternatively, it could mean that these companies are more profitable allowing them to shell out higher preferred stock dividends, which would be contradictory to the hypothesis. Referring back to the heatmap, notice that preferred stock dividends has a decent correlation with total revenue. Lets analyze this further.\n\nsns.lineplot(x='Total Revenue', y='Preferred Stock Dividends', data=heatmap_data, marker='o')\nplt.title('Average Preferred Stock Dividends vs Total Revenue')\nplt.xlabel('Average Preferred Stock Dividends')\nplt.ylabel('Total Revenue')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Total Revenue')\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter analyzing the graph, we notice the slight positive trend between “Total Revenue” and “Average Preferred Stock Dividends”. This indicates that companies with higher total revenues tend to shell out more preferred stock, thus contradicting our hypothesis relating to the social risk score. Lets plot both total revenue and social risk score together over average preferred stock dividends to get a better visualization.\n\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))\nsns.lineplot(x='Preferred Stock Dividends', y='Total Revenue', data=heatmap_data, ax=ax1, marker='o', color='b', label='Total Revenue')\nax2 = ax1.twinx()\nsns.lineplot(x='Preferred Stock Dividends', y='Social Risk Score', data=heatmap_data, ax=ax2, marker='o', color='r', label='Social Risk Score')\nax1.set_title('Total Revenue and Social Risk Score vs Average Preferred Stock Dividends', fontsize=16)\nax1.set_xlabel('Average Preferred Stock Dividends', fontsize=14)\nax1.set_ylabel('Total Revenue', fontsize=14, color='b')\nax2.set_ylabel('Social Risk Score', fontsize=14, color='r')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Social Risk Score')\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see in the graphed data, as social risk score and average perferred stock dividends increase, total revenue also increases. This disproves our hypothesis testing if risk scores are associated with poorer financial health and lower profitability.\n##Significance\nThough most of the data is inconclusive due to low correlations, the moderate correlation between “Average Preferred Stock Dividends” and “Social Risk Score” provides slight implications. By plotting ‘Total Revenue’ and ‘Social Risk Score’ against ‘Average Preferred Stock Dividends’, its clear to see that social risk score is associated with the inverse of our hypothesis.\n##Results\nIn general, there is little to no relationships between risk scores and financial health. However, if there is a correlation, it is contradictory to our hypothesis as risk scores are more associated with better financial health, rather than poor financial health."

Here are some specific analyses we can perform:\n\nCalculate the total quantity and spending for each brand.\nFind the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase.\nCompare the total spending across different markets.\n\nI’ll begin with these analyses and create visualizations to help us understand the data better. Let’s start by calculating the total quantity and spending for each brand.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Reading the CSV file\nbeer_data = pd.read_csv(\"https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv\")\n\n# Setting up the visualisation settings\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n# Calculate total quantity and spending for each brand\nbrand_summary = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({'quantity':'sum', 'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total quantity and spending\nbrand_summary_sorted_quantity = brand_summary.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)\nbrand_summary_sorted_spent = brand_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n\n# Plotting total quantity for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=brand_summary_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Total Quantity')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# Plotting total spending for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=brand_summary_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar charts above display the total quantity of beer purchased and the total spending by brand. From the looks of it, certain brands dominate in terms of quantity sold and total spending, indicating their popularity.\nNow, let’s calculate the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase. For this, we’ll consider each row in the dataset as a separate purchase and compute the averages accordingly.\n\n# Calculate average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase\naverage_purchase = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({\n    'quantity': 'mean', \n    'dollar_spent': 'mean'\n}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by average quantity and average spending\naverage_purchase_sorted_quantity = average_purchase.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)\naverage_purchase_sorted_spent = average_purchase.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting average quantity for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Quantity')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# Plotting average spending for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Spending on Beer by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations above depict the average quantity of beer purchased per brand and the average spending per brand. This shows which brands tend to be bought in larger quantities on average and which brands tend to have higher spending per purchase, which could be indicative of their price point or the purchase of premium products.\nNext, we’ll look at the total spending across different markets to see if there are any notable differences in spending habits geographically. To do this, we’ll sum up the spending in each market and visualize it.\n\n# Calculate total spending in each market\nmarket_spending_summary = beer_data.groupby('market').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nmarket_spending_summary_sorted = market_spending_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending in each market\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='market', data=market_spending_summary_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Market')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Market')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the total spending on beer by market, showcasing the differences in spending habits across various regions. Some markets have significantly higher spending, which could be due to a variety of factors including market size, consumer preferences, or economic factors.\nNow, let’s move on to the second analysis:"

It appears that certain age groups are more dominant in beer spending, which may align with the purchasing power or preferences of those groups.\nNext, we will examine spending by employment status.\n\n# Calculate total spending by employment status\nemployment_spending = beer_data.groupby('employment').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nemployment_spending_sorted = employment_spending.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending by employment status\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='employment', data=employment_spending_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Employment Status')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Employment Status')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization shows the total spending on beer by employment status. We can see that certain employment groups, such as full-time workers, are spending more on beer, which might be related to their disposable income.\nFinally, let’s look at spending by race to complete the demographic analysis.\n\n# Calculate total spending by race\nrace_spending = beer_data.groupby('race').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nrace_spending_sorted = race_spending.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending by race\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='race', data=race_spending_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Race')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Race')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart above indicates the total spending on beer broken down by race, highlighting which racial groups account for the most beer spending within the dataset. This could reflect both the demographics of the regions where the data was collected and cultural preferences regarding beer.\nNow, let’s proceed to the third analysis:"

This gives us a sense of whether there’s a relationship between the price and the quantity purchased. The x-axis labels are quite compressed due to the number of brands, but we can still observe trends such as whether lower-priced beers tend to be purchased in larger quantities.\nLastly, let’s move to the fourth analysis:"

A positive value indicates that, on average, more beer is purchased when there is a promotion compared to when there isn’t. Some brands appear to be significantly more influenced by promotions, with customers buying more when the products are on sale or promotion.\nThis comprehensive analysis has provided insights into purchase patterns, demographic preferences, price sensitivity, and the impact of promotions on beer purchases."

This was easy to assume with the correlation coefficient of .43, however, there is some indication that as the “Social Risk Score” increases, the “Average Preferred Stock Dividends” increases. This may indicate that companies with higher social risk scores offer higher preferred stock dividends in order to retain investors despite the higher risk. Alternatively, it could mean that these companies are more profitable allowing them to shell out higher preferred stock dividends, which would be contradictory to the hypothesis. Referring back to the heatmap, notice that preferred stock dividends has a decent correlation with total revenue.

This indicates that companies with higher total revenues tend to shell out more preferred stock, thus contradicting our hypothesis relating to the social risk score. Lets plot both total revenue and social risk score together over average preferred stock dividends to get a better visualization.\n\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))\nsns.lineplot(x='Preferred Stock Dividends', y='Total Revenue', data=heatmap_data, ax=ax1, marker='o', color='b', label='Total Revenue')\nax2 = ax1.twinx()\nsns.lineplot(x='Preferred Stock Dividends', y='Social Risk Score', data=heatmap_data, ax=ax2, marker='o', color='r', label='Social Risk Score')\nax1.set_title('Total Revenue and Social Risk Score vs Average Preferred Stock Dividends', fontsize=16)\nax1.set_xlabel('Average Preferred Stock Dividends', fontsize=14)\nax1.set_ylabel('Total Revenue', fontsize=14, color='b')\nax2.set_ylabel('Social Risk Score', fontsize=14, color='r')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Social Risk Score')\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see in the graphed data, as social risk score and average perferred stock dividends increase, total revenue also increases.
